## Convex Polygon Collisions
<p>This project introduces several techniques to handle 
convex polygon collisions.</p>
<!--
<p>A polygon is defined by points connected by stretch edges. 
A Concave polygon can be identified because it has at lease one 
internal angle greater than 180 degrees. This techniques only
work for convex polygons.</p>
<p>Axis Aligned Bounding Box or "AABB"</p>
<p>Separated Axis Theorem</p>
